# Story: Small Worlds

## Research Motivation

This model explores the formation of networks that result in the "small world" phenomenon -- the idea that a person is only a couple of connections away from any other person in the world.

A popular example of the small world phenomenon is the network formed by actors appearing in the same movie (e.g., "[Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon)"), but small worlds are not limited to people-only networks. Other examples range from power grids to the neural networks of worms. This model illustrates some general, theoretical conditions under which small world networks between people or things might occur.

## Research Goal

This model is an adaptation of the [Watts-Strogatz model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts-Strogatz_model) proposed by Duncan Watts and Steve Strogatz (1998). It begins with a network where each person (or "node") is connected to his or her two neighbors on either side. Using this a base, we then modify the network by rewiring nodes–changing one end of a connected pair of nodes and keeping the other end the same. Over time, we analyze the effect this rewiring has the on various connections between nodes and on the properties of the network.

Particularly, we're interested in identifying "small worlds." To identify small worlds, the "average path length" (abbreviated "apl") and "clustering coefficient" (abbreviated "cc") of the network are calculated and plotted after a rewiring is performed. Networks with _short_ average path lengths and _high_ clustering coefficients are considered small world networks. See the **Statistics** section of HOW TO USE IT on how these are calculated.

## Agent Description

**Turtle** agent with properties:
- `distance-from-other-turtles`
- `my-clustering-coefficient`

## Spatial Structure

Grid-based model with mobile agents.

## Dynamics

The NUM-NODES slider controls the size of the network. Choose a size and press SETUP.

Pressing the REWIRE-ONE button picks one edge at random, rewires it, and then plots the resulting network properties in the "Network Properties Rewire-One" graph. The REWIRE-ONE button _ignores_ the REWIRING-PROBABILITY slider. It will always rewire one exactly one edge in the network that has not yet been rewired _unless_ all edges in the network have already been rewired.
